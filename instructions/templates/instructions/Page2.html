<p>
    This experiment will consist of <b>two parts</b>, each divided into several rounds.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the experiment, you will be paid {{ fee }}, plus earnings based on the points you have earned during the experiment.
    The computer will calculate your average score across all rounds.
    This value will then be converted at an exchange rate of AED{{rate_value}} per point and rounded to the nearest integer.
    To sum up, your final payment is given by the following formula:
    <center>
    <em>
        {{fee}}  <span>+</span>  AED{{rate_value}} <span>&times;</span> (your average score)
    </em>
    </center>
</p>
<br>
<p class="a">
    Note: in the unlikely event that your average score is negative, you will earn {{fee}}.

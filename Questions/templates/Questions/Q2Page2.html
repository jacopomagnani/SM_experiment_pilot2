<p>
    Players A, B and C bid the same value and therefore the computer will randomly determine their ranking.
</p>
<p>
    In Group 2, the highest bidder is player E and the second-highest bidder is player D.
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines B is the highest bidder in his group, then he will be paired with player E and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(E's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 2<span>&times;</span>2<span>&minus;</span>3 = 4-3=1
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines B is the second-highest bidder in his group, then he will be paired with player D and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(D's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 2<span>&times;</span>5<span>&minus;</span>3 = 10-3=7
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines B is the lowest bidder in his group, then he will be unpaired and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    0<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) =0<span>&minus;</span>3 =-3
</p>
<p>
    Thus, player B may earn any of these three scores, depending on the random choice of the computer.

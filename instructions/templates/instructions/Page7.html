<ul>
    <li>You cannot choose with whom to form a pair.</li>
    <li>However, you can try to influence the way in which you are paired to others by submitting a <b>bid</b>.</li>
    <li>A bid is a number between 0 and 50. Each <b>bid is subtracted from your points</b> at the end of the round.
        If you do not want to bid, then you can choose to bid zero.</li>
    <li>After all players in a market have submitted their bids, the <b>computer will rank the bids</b> of the three players in Group 1 from highest to lowest.</li>
    <li>Similarly, the computer will rank the bids of the two players in Group 2 from highest to lowest.</li>
    <li>The <b>computer will then pair players whose bids have the same ranking</b>, that is:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>the player who submitted the highest bid in Group 1 is paired with the  player who submitted the highest bid in Group 2.</li>
            <li>the player who submitted the second-highest bid in Group 1 is paired with the  player who submitted the second-highest bid in Group 2.</li>
            <li>the player who submitted the lowest bid in Group 1 remains unpaired.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>The <b>computer will randomly break any tie</b>: if two or three players in the same group have submitted the same bid, the computer will randomly rank their bids.</li>
</ul>

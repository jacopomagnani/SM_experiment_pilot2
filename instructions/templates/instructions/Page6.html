<ul>
    <li><b>You will not know the type of the participant</b> you are paired with in a round.</li>
    <li>However, <b>you will receive a clue</b> about your potential partner’s type. Clues are determined in the following way.</li>
    <li>The computer will digitally draw a random ball from <b>a box containing 24 balls</b> of different colors.</li>
    <li>Each ball can be either <b>blue, yellow or red</b>.</li>
    <li>The number of blue, yellow and red balls in <b>the box depends on your partner’s type</b>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="small">If your partner’s type is X, the box contains no blue balls, 12 yellow balls and 12 red balls.</li>
        <li class="small">If your partner’s type is Y, the box contains 24 yellow balls but no blue or red balls.</li>
        <li class="small">If your partner’s type is Z, the box contains 12 blue balls, 12 yellow balls and no red balls.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The boxes used in the experiment are illustrated in the figure below.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>To give you a clue about the type of your potential partner, <b>the computer will first determine which box to use given your partner’s type</b>.</li>
    <li>Then <b>it will digitally draw a random ball</b>: each single ball in the box has the same probability of being selected, equal to 1/24.</li>
    <li>The clue you receive is the color of this randomly drawn ball.</li>
</ul>

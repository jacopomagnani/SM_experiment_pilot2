<p>
    Player B bid 8 and the other players in his group bid 10 and 6.
    Thus, player B is the second-highest bidder in his group.
</p>
<p>
    In Group 2, both players bid the same value.
    Therefore, the computer will randomly determine the ranking of their bids.
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines D is the second-highest bidder in his group, then player B will be paired with player D and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(D's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 4<span>&times;</span>3<span>&minus;</span>8 = 12-8=4
</p>
<p>
    If the computer determines E is the second-highest bidder in his group, then player B will be paired with player E and his score will be:
</p>
<p class="c">
    (B's multiplier)<span>&times;</span>(E's multiplier)<span>&minus;</span>(B's bid) = 4<span>&times;</span>5<span>&minus;</span>6 = 20-6=12
</p>
<p>
    Thus, player B may earn either of these two scores, depending on the random choice of the computer.
    However, player B has no chance to earn -8 points.
    That would happen only if both A and C bid more than B, in which case B would remain unpaired.
